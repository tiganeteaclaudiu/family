Sequence for realtime chat:

    - when user logs in, 30 messages are queried - DONE
    - each time a message is sent via socket, it can be loaded 2 ways:
        - a each-every-5-seconds polling query is done to check that all the latest messages are loaded
        - the message is received via socket to other users in the room

        Things to try:
            - see if it's possible to get a 'message received' response when the user receives a message via socket
                -this would mean emitting the message to the room via a thread, while another timeout thread checks if a response is received
